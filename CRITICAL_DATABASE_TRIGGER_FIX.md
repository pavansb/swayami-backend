# 🚨 CRITICAL: Database Trigger Fix Required

## ❌ **ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED**

The authentication failure is caused by a **Supabase database trigger** that fires during OAuth signup and fails because it tries to insert into a non-existent `profiles` table.

## 🔍 **Evidence from Debug Info:**
- **Auth Code: None** ← Critical: OAuth flow never completes
- **User: None** ← No session created
- **Error: Database error saving new user** ← Trigger failure

## 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE PERMANENT FIX**

### **Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `nqpvomjuaszhwfdhnmik`
3. Navigate to: **SQL Editor** (left sidebar)

### **Step 2: Run This SQL Command**
Copy and paste this exact command:

```sql
-- Remove the problematic database trigger
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_auth_user_created ON auth.users;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.handle_new_user();

-- Verify triggers are removed
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name = 'on_auth_user_created';
```

### **Step 3: Verify Fix**
The query should return **0 rows**, confirming the trigger is removed.

## 🎯 **Why This Fixes The Issue**

1. **Current Problem**: Trigger tries to insert into `profiles` table that doesn't exist
2. **Trigger Purpose**: Was meant to create user profiles in Supabase database
3. **Why It's Safe to Remove**: You're using MongoDB for user data now
4. **Result**: OAuth flow will complete without database errors

## ⚡ **Alternative: Temporary Auth Bypass (If SQL Access Unavailable)**

If you can't access the SQL Editor immediately, I'll implement a bypass that creates users directly via Supabase API:

```typescript
// Alternative approach - bypass the trigger by using direct API calls
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.admin.createUser({
  email: 'user@example.com',
  password: 'temporary-password',
  email_confirm: true
});
```

## 🔄 **Expected Results After Fix**

### **Before Fix (Current)**:
```
❌ OAuth initiated → Google redirect → Database trigger fails → Error page
Auth Code: None
User: None
```

### **After Fix**:
```
✅ OAuth initiated → Google redirect → Auth success → User session created → Dashboard
Auth Code: abc123...
User: your.email@gmail.com
```

## 🚀 **Test Instructions**

1. **Apply the SQL fix** in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Clear browser cache** and cookies for localhost
3. **Go to**: `http://localhost:3000`
4. **Click**: "Sign in with Google"
5. **Expected**: Clean OAuth flow without errors

## 📋 **Backup Plan**

If you're still having issues after the SQL fix, there might be additional triggers or policies. In that case, we can:

1. **Check for other triggers**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE event_object_schema = 'auth';
```

2. **Disable RLS temporarily**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE auth.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

3. **Create a manual auth bypass** in the application code

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED**

**You must run the SQL command to fix this permanently.** All other solutions are temporary workarounds. The database trigger is the root cause and needs to be removed.

**Priority: URGENT** - This single SQL command will resolve your authentication issues immediately.
